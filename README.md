# -Farmware-Circle
Makes your farmbot follow a pseudo-circle shape on the X-Y plane.
You can specify the diameter and the nuber of points on the webapp.
Please note that a high number of points equals to a longer travel time, as the farmbot has to stop at each point.
Recommended values range from 7 to 12 points, but lower or higher values are possible.

/!\ This script *will not* check if there is enough room around the farmbot to move. Make sure you have 'stop at home' 'and stop at max' enabled, or you might damage something
